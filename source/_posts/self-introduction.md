self-introduction in English class.

<!--more-->

I believe that most of you heard a famous and excellent politician whose name is Ziyi Guo living in the Tang Dynasty. Not only we both have similar name but also I always regard him as my spirit leader. His courage fighting enemies and wisdom settling political challenges influence my personality deeply. With his spirit shining in my heart, an unforgettable experience which reshapes my character hit my life.

Once a time in university, I was very lucky to be nominated for The Star of Self-Improvement. But what followed happiness was anxiety about making a campaign speech in front of all of students. What a terrible thing! For about twenty years, I almost hadn\`t done that. Whenever I thought of that speech at that time, my heart seemed to be blocked by a huge stone. I counldn\`t forget the terrible experience that I was laughed by two girls when giving a lecture in font of the classroom. How shy, unconfident and even scared I was at that time!
The speech was unavoidable. Just like countless wars emerged in Guo`s life endlessly. He must face them and devote himself to those wars. His unfearful spirit shows me that the best way to eliminate fear is to face it. After thinking and thinking, I decided to make speech trainings at seaside in the moring. 

Facing the choppy sea that was always roaring, it seemed that I was fighting against it. The louder it yelled, the more enthusiastic I felt. With heavy wind coming, it was just like the sea monster would swallow me whole up. I had no place to hide in but to staring at the huge monster. Although my whole body kept trembling fiercely, I must keep standing there firmly and shout back with my loudest sound that was full of power. I had to defeat it! At that moment, the sense of fear in front of thousands of students was fading away. The audience is far less fearful than the violent monster.

With successful speech, I succeeded in getting that award. It is not only about the award itself but about the reshaping of personality. Led by Ziyi Guo`s living example, confidence, courage and passion run to my life shining like the sun. There goes a fashion saying that those who can't kill you will eventually make you stronger. I believe that firmly with no doubt. Challenges are always appearing endlessly and what I can do is just used to facing them courageously.
